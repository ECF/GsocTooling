TSHWizard.name = TimeService Host Project
TSHWizard.description = Creates a sample Remote Service that acts as the host and will be exposed by ECF as a remote service. It exposes a simple Time Service API that clients ask OSGi to inject when it becomes available. This version of the Service will be set-up in java code. Please see the DS examples on how to declaratively expose such a service.
TSCWizard.name = TimeService Consumer Project
TSCWizard.description = Creates a sample consumer that will start listening for a TimeService service provided by com.mycorp.examples.TimeService. This set-up will be done programmatically. Please see the DS examples on how to declaratively consume such a service. Calls to the TimeService will block until they return or fail. Please take a look at the async version of this provider if you want non-blocking remot service calls.
